title=Fixable back holes
description=Ever found that your pristine clothing has one hole you can't patch? Well, now you can. Turns out that all clothing had one more part it covered that wasn't included in the UI, and this fixes that! Just remember that padding on your back doesn't affect your armor stats in any way, it's only cosmetic.
