title=Far More Perishable Food
description=An autopatcher that makes the game harder.
description=No item lasts forever anymore. Every piece of food in the game spoils now. The only exception is Honey. Honey never spoils. (And Bleach. And a couple other items by default but those can be disabled)

description=The mod features sandbox settings, letting you set a blacklist of items(prevents adjustment) and a manual override list(for customized values). You also have control over each broad category of items. More categories are added with each update
description=
description=This mod encourages you to start a new save. Due to how items work, all non-perishable food spawned before the mod's installation will not get adjusted. If you do want your items to begin perishing, enable the Sandbox Option "Enable Existing Items Adjustment"(For singleplayer saves, I recommend a mod that lets you modify sandbox settings). Be aware that the function can cause a noticeable performance hit, it is only meant as a backwards-compatibility option!
