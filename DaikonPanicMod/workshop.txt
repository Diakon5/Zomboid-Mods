title=Panic Over time Increase Fix
description=This mod aims to fix a vanilla bug with panic reduction increase over time. In vanilla, your panic reduction increases with every month you survive. Makes sense you get used to the zombies, however, it's tied to the save's time, not the player's actually survived time. This results in players enjoing a maximized panic reduction in Multiplayer(assuming the server has been running for long enough), and even in Singleplayer, if you die and choose to respawn in the same save...

description=NO MORE!

description=Now the panic reduction is tied to your character's actual survived hours!  Included are sandbox options for extra customization, letting you add an extra couple hours to your starting panic reduction, as well as letting you gain panic reduction with each zombie kill
